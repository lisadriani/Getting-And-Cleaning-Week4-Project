# Getting-And-Cleaning-Week4-Project
Coursera Course Getting and Cleaning Data: Week 4 Final Project. 

This repo was made as directed on the course website. 

This repo has directions on how it cleans and tidies the data for the Human Activity Recognition Sheet. 

The original data can be found : https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Codebook.md describes the steps taken to tidy the data for a follow along instruction. 
Run_analysis.R is the exact code used on the dataset above. It follows the five steps as directed by the course requirement 
  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
  From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
